        I am a determined and passionate individual with a diverse background
        and experience in the world of technology and web development. Born in
        Rasht and having spent the majority of my childhood in Tehran, I
        developed a love for sports, particularly football, during my early
        years.
        <br />
        <br />I had the opportunity to showcase my talent as a football player
        in the Esteqlal FC under 20 team, which instilled in me a sense of
        discipline, teamwork, and dedication. As I moved to Rasht, my focus
        shifted towards pursuing a career in the field of software engineering.
        I attended Chamran University, where I earned my degree in Software
        Engineering, laying a solid foundation for my future endeavors.
        <br />
        <br />
        My journey in the technology industry officially began when I joined
        Khazar Informatic company at the age of 20. There, I honed my skills in
        software installation, hardware and laptop repair, and network
        management, gaining valuable hands-on experience in these areas. To
        further expand my expertise, I moved on to Nilasoft company, where I
        immersed myself in the world of web design, specifically working with
        WordPress. My goal was to create personalized and exceptional websites
        for clients, combining my proficiency in CSS, HTML, and WordPress. I
        continuously pushed myself to become a top-notch WordPress designer.
        <br />
        <br />
        With a thirst for new challenges and growth, I took the opportunity to
        advance my skills in frontend development by joining Pezhvak Dadeh
        Khazar company. There, I completed training in React JS and actively
        contributed to the development of the Pikapp dashboard, utilizing
        technologies such as React, Bootstrap, and TypeScript. This experience
        further expanded my knowledge in frontend development and enriched my
        problem-solving capabilities.
        <br />
        <br /> Recently, I have ventured into working as a freelancer, focusing
        on projects involving NextJS and WordPress. My aim is to leverage the
        power of NextJS to develop high-quality and user-friendly websites for
        my clients, always striving to exceed their expectations. As I near the
        completion of my military service, I am eager to join a forward-thinking
        and dynamic company that values innovation and creativity in the
        technology industry. If you are interested in discussing potential
        opportunities, please feel free to contact me through the contact
        section on my website.
        <br />
        <br /> I look forward to bringing my skills, passion, and determination
        to contribute to the success of your esteemed organization. Thank you
        for considering my profile.
